# Keybindings

Edit keybindings from **Settings** → **Keybindings**. That page lists every command, its current
shortcut, whether it is a default or your own, and warns about conflicts.

## Composer controls

In **Settings → General → Send shortcut**, choose whether Enter sends, requires
`mod+Enter` for multiline prompts, or always requires `mod+Enter`. `Shift+Enter`
inserts a new line. This applies to the web and desktop composer at desktop widths.

**Follow-up behavior** chooses Wait, Queue, or Steer while the agent runs. Use
`mod+Enter` to do the opposite for one message. When sending requires `mod+Enter`,
use `mod+Shift+Enter` for the opposite action. Muse and Agy always wait. In a new
thread, `mod+Enter` keeps starting the thread in the background.

Use `mod+shift+m` to choose a model and `mod+shift+h` to choose a host.
Use `mod+shift+e` for effort, `mod+shift+a` for access mode, `mod+shift+x` for the
workspace, and `mod+shift+g` for the Git branch. The workspace menu includes the
current checkout, a new worktree, and the previous worktree when available.
Use `mod+shift+l` to reuse the previous worktree directly.

In the model picker, press Left in an empty search field or Shift+Tab to reach
the provider list. Use Up/Down to move and Enter to choose. Right returns to
model search. `mod+shift+up` and `mod+shift+down` switch providers directly and clear the
search. These provider shortcuts can also be changed in Settings.

These shortcuts run inside the focused web or desktop client. `mod` uses Command
on macOS and Ctrl on Windows and Linux, including GNOME, KDE Plasma, Niri, and
Hyprland. If a custom desktop shortcut takes the same keys, choose another binding
in Settings.

## Copy pull request references

With a PR open in the right panel or on the Pull Requests page, use `mod+shift+c`
to copy its URL and `mod+shift+k` to copy its number with a `#` prefix.
Both shortcuts can be changed in Settings. Search for "Copy Link or Thread ID"
or "Copy Number". They copy the selected PR and leave terminal input alone.

## iPad

With a hardware keyboard, use `Cmd+1` through `Cmd+9` to open the first nine
displayed threads. The shortcuts follow the current list filters and order.
`Cmd+K` opens the command palette to search commands, projects, and threads.
Use the arrow keys and Return to choose a result, or `Cmd+1` through `Cmd+9` to
choose directly. Escape or `Cmd+K` closes the palette. Start a search with `>`
to show only actions.

In the composer, Return sends and `Shift+Return` inserts a new line. `Cmd+Return`
also sends. To make Return insert a new line instead, change the Return key
behavior in Settings → Keyboard.

The same configuration lives in `~/.t3/userdata/keybindings.json` on the machine running the
server, if you prefer editing it directly. d4research writes the built-in defaults into that file on
first run, and adds any new defaults on later startups unless a rule of yours already claims the
command or the shortcut.

The file is a JSON array of rules.

```json
[
  { "key": "mod+g", "command": "terminal.toggle" },
  { "key": "mod+shift+g", "command": "terminal.new", "when": "terminalFocus" }
]
```

Invalid rules are ignored. An invalid file is ignored entirely, and the server logs a warning.

## Rule Shape

- `key` (required): shortcut string, like `mod+j`, `ctrl+k`, `cmd+shift+d`
- `command` (required): the command ID to run
- `when` (optional): boolean expression controlling when the shortcut is active

## Key Syntax

Modifiers: `mod` (`cmd` on macOS, `ctrl` elsewhere), `cmd` / `meta`, `ctrl` / `control`, `shift`,
`alt` / `option`.

Examples: `mod+j`, `mod+shift+d`, `ctrl+l`, `cmd+k`.

## Commands

Commands are IDs like `terminal.toggle`, `commandPalette.toggle`, `preview.refresh`, and
`chat.new`. Project scripts use the format `script.{id}.run`, for example `script.test.run`.
Available context keys are `terminalFocus`, `terminalOpen`, `previewFocus`,
`previewOpen`, `modelPickerOpen`, `editableFocus`, `isWeb`, and `isDesktop`.
`editableFocus` is true while a text field, the composer, or another editor has
the keyboard. `isWeb` is true in a browser tab. `isDesktop` is true in the
desktop app. Unknown keys evaluate to `false`.

`mod+1` through `mod+9` jump to the first nine threads, and to models while the
model picker is open. Those defaults use `isDesktop` so they do not steal the
browser's tab-switch shortcuts. Remove that condition in Settings if you want
the same jumps in a browser.

`filePicker.toggle` opens file search for the active project and defaults to `mod+p`.
`projectSearch.toggle` searches inside the active project's files and defaults to `mod+shift+f`.
Repeating either shortcut closes that search, and switching shortcuts replaces the open search.
`themeEditor.toggle` opens or closes the floating theme editor and defaults to
`mod+alt+shift+t`. Select a color label to spotlight the elements that use it; select the label
again to clear the spotlight. The swatch and hex field keep that color selected while you edit it.
Advanced mode groups related app tokens into a smaller set of color families. Changing a family
updates its paired text and interaction states while leaving every unrelated imported color intact.
Use **Inspect** to pick an element in the app and reveal its color token. Inspect disarms after one
successful pick; its hover glow and badge preview the element and color family that click will select.
**Cancel** or `Escape` exits Inspect and clears its selection and spotlight.

`rightPanel.toggleMaximized` maximizes or restores the open right panel. It has no default shortcut,
so add one in **Settings** → **Keybindings** if you want to use it.

`rightPanel.close` closes the active right panel tab and defaults to `mod+w`. Press it again to close
the next tab. With the terminal focused, `mod+w` closes the terminal instead, and with nothing left
to close it closes the desktop window as before. Browsers reserve `mod+w` for closing their own tab
and never pass it to the page, so in a browser rebind this command (and `terminal.close`) to a
shortcut the browser leaves alone, such as `alt+w`.

`thread.copyReference` copies the active thread's pull request link, or its thread ID when no pull
request is available. Its default shortcut is `mod+shift+c`, and it does not replace terminal copy
while the terminal has focus.

`thread.settle` settles the active thread or restores it if already settled. Its default
shortcut is `mod+shift+s`, and it does not run while the terminal has focus.

`thread.pin` pins the active thread to the pinned section of the sidebar or unpins it if already
pinned. Its default shortcut is `mod+shift+p`, and it does not run while the terminal has focus.
See [Organizing threads](./thread-sidebar.md) for how pinned threads are ordered.

The command palette searches settings, active thread titles, projects, branches, user messages, and
final agent responses across connected environments. A setting result opens its exact control or
section. Message matches show one labeled excerpt while keeping the thread's project, branch, and
machine context visible. Message search begins after two characters and uses SQLite's ASCII
case-insensitive matching.

The full command list and the current defaults are shown in **Settings** → **Keybindings**, which
always matches the build you are running. Use that rather than a copied list.

`thread.stop` interrupts the running turn in the focused thread. It has no default
shortcut; assign one in **Settings → Keybindings**.

`thread.undo` (`mod+z` by default) reverses the actions shown in the notice at the
bottom of the sidebar, such as unpin, settle, snooze, or archive. Consecutive
actions of the same kind undo together. The notice remains available for five
seconds after the latest action. The default shortcut skips text fields and
terminals so native undo keeps working there.

`chat.new` may ask you to choose a project when there is more than one.
`chat.newLocal` skips that chooser. Both use your
[new-thread defaults](./thread-sidebar.md#start-a-thread).

Note that `chat.new` and `chat.newLocal` both create a thread through the same path. A new thread
inherits the project you were in, along with model and mode selections. Branch, worktree, and
environment mode always come from your configured defaults, not from the thread you were looking
at. To keep a worktree, use the explicit "new thread in this worktree" action in the branch
toolbar. The only difference between the two commands: with the current sidebar and more than one
project, `chat.new` opens a project chooser first.

Background submission from a new thread is the exception. `mod+enter` starts that thread and opens
another new thread with the same workspace mode and base branch. **New worktree** remains selected,
but the new thread does not reuse the worktree created for the thread that just started.

## `when` Conditions

A `when` expression checks context keys that describe the current UI state. The app currently
provides `terminalFocus`, `terminalOpen`, `previewFocus`, `previewOpen`, and `modelPickerOpen`.
This list is open and grows over time, so treat it as the current set rather than a fixed one.
Any key the running app does not supply evaluates to `false`.

Operators: `!` (not), `&&` (and), `||` (or), and parentheses.

Examples:

- `"when": "terminalFocus"`
- `"when": "terminalOpen && !terminalFocus"`
- `"when": "!terminalFocus"`

## Precedence

- Rules are evaluated in array order.
- For a key event, the last rule where both `key` matches and `when` evaluates to `true` wins.
- Precedence is across commands, not only within the same command. A later rule for a different
  command can take a key away from an earlier one.
