# Settings and project overrides

## Project quick access

On web and desktop, right-click a project in the narrow project rail and choose **Settle project**
to hide its quick-access shortcut. The project stays in the sidebar's project dropdown and in
the project picker for new threads. Its threads keep running normally.

Use the rail's **Settled projects** archive icon to open one of those projects. To return its
shortcut to the rail, choose it under **Unsettle project** in the same menu. These choices are
saved on this device, together with your rail groups and order.

## Settings scope

On web and desktop, the "Applying settings for …" sentence at the top of Settings pages picks
the project and environment a change applies to. Pages that only hold device preferences, such as
Appearance, don't show it. They start at **All projects** and **All environments**
and stay selected as you move between categories or search for a setting.

Preferences saved on this device, such as appearance, confirmations and browser profiles, always
show and ignore the selection. Everything else is stored on a server. Choose one environment to
edit its settings, or leave **All environments** to edit every connected environment at once.
Offline environments keep their current values; this is a bulk edit, not a synced global default.

Choose a project to override settings for it on the selected environments. A layers icon beside
each server row's title shows where the value comes from: the built-in default, the environment,
or a project override. Click it to see that chain on every selected environment. An override can
be reset to inherit again. Settings that cannot be overridden by a project are shown read-only
while a project is selected.

When the selected environments disagree, the control shows **Mixed** in place of a value and the
layers icon turns amber. Picking a value applies it to every selected environment.

Changing an environment value never touches a project's own override. When projects override the
setting you are editing, the layers icon counts them and the chain lists each one with its value:
click a project to jump to it, or **Reset all** to make those projects follow the environment
again.

Providers and diagnostics are per machine: they show one environment at a time, the primary
one until you pick another. Every other setting fans out to the selection.

With a project selected, a provider's switch in **Settings → Providers** turns it on or off for
that project only, in either direction: a provider off on the machine can be used in one project,
and one on everywhere can be kept out of another. That project's model pickers follow the switch,
and no new turn there can start on a provider it turned off, including queued messages and
follow-ups from delegated tasks. A turn already running when the switch flips finishes. A delegated
task's result still lands in its parent thread, which sees it on its next turn. Reset returns the project to the
machine's setting. Every other provider setting stays per machine.

On mobile, open **Settings** and use the filter in its header to choose connected environments
and a project. The filter stays available in server-setting pages. With **All projects** selected,
the server-setting pages, such as Threads, Source control and Worktrees, edit the selected
environments' defaults. Choosing a project edits its overrides on the selected
environments. Use **Use defaults** in a page to remove that page's project overrides.
Open **Settings → Projects** to rename the project across its selected
connected checkouts and see where those checkouts live.
Settings that are environment-wide stay read-only while a project is selected. When selected
targets disagree, a control shows **Mixed** until you choose one value. Appearance, keyboard,
and other phone-only settings ignore the filter.

## Attach folders to a project

On web or desktop, use **Add project** in the command palette and choose an existing
project before selecting the folder. For a folder already added, open its project
settings and choose **Grouping → Show under another project**.

This grouping is saved on this device. Files, threads, and agent working directories
stay in place. To undo an attachment, open the combined project's settings and choose
**Detach** for that folder. Scratch projects cannot be attached.

## Pin and archive projects

Pinned projects come first in the project picker on a new thread, the new-thread list, the command palette, the sidebar project filter, and mobile. In **Boring sidebar (group by project)**, pinned projects occupy the top
folders, even with no active threads. Pin or unpin a project from its row in any of those lists,
or press the thread pin shortcut (`mod+shift+p` by default) on the highlighted row. **Pin
project** in the command palette and **Settings → Projects** work too. A list keeps its order
while it is open, so a new pin moves up the next time you open it.

Archive a project you are done with in **Settings → Projects**. It leaves the project pickers.
Its threads, settings, and files stay as they are, and archived projects still show in the
Settings project list, marked **Archived**. Choose one there and select **Unarchive** to bring it
back. On mobile, both are in **Settings → Projects → Organize**.

To pin or archive a project that is on several machines, every machine must be connected.

## Worktree branch names

In **Settings → Worktrees → Worktree branch naming**, choose a static prefix,
a model-selected semantic prefix such as `feat/` or `fix/`, or custom instructions
for the complete name. The static prefix defaults to `t3/`; a trailing slash is
optional, and an empty prefix adds nothing. Invalid characters in a static prefix
are replaced with hyphens. Custom instructions are appended to
the naming prompt and can specify issue IDs, namespaces, and casing.

These settings apply to automatically named new worktree branches. Select a project
to override its environment defaults. Worktree directories keep their original names.
If generation fails, or a custom name is invalid or already taken, the temporary
branch name remains.

## Scheduled tasks on mobile

Open **Settings → Scheduled tasks** to create scheduled tasks or manage existing
ones across your connected environments. Use the settings filter to narrow the
list by environment or project. Each task runs on the environment you choose,
using its project, model, and workspace settings. Fixed-time schedules use that
environment's time zone, which may differ from your phone's. Choose **Once**
to run a task a single time at a date and time in your own time zone. If the
environment is offline then, the task runs when it is back.

Deleting a thread also deletes tasks that post into that thread. Tasks that start
a new thread on each run survive deletion of their previous threads.

You can edit, pause, resume, run immediately, or delete a task from the list.
Webhook tasks only run when their URL is called, so they can't be run
immediately.
Leaving an edited form asks before discarding unsaved changes.

## Webhook automations

In **Settings → Scheduled tasks**, choose **On webhook**
as a task's schedule to run it whenever another service calls its URL, such as
GitHub on a new pull request or a CI job that failed. After you save the task,
copy its URL from the editor. The sender must be able to reach that address.
For a cloud service, expose the environment through an HTTPS proxy you control;
a localhost or Tailscale address alone is not reachable by that service.
**Rotate** replaces the URL and the old one stops working.

The prompt decides what the agent sees. Placeholders pull values out of the
request: `{{body.path}}` for a JSON or form field, `{{headers.name}}`,
`{{query.name}}`, `{{body}}` for the raw body, and `{{request}}` for everything.
For example, `Review this PR: {{body.pull_request.html_url}}` sends only the
pull request link. A placeholder with no value is left empty.

Each value reaches the agent wrapped in `<webhook-data-…>` tags and marked as
untrusted request data. This helps the agent tell it apart from your
instructions, but it doesn't guarantee the agent ignores what the text says.
Inside a value, every `$`, other currency sign and `@`, and a `/` that starts
a lone word, gets an invisible character after it, so mentions like `$skill`,
`@file` and `/command` don't act. Text copied from a value, such as an email
address or a command, carries that character too. Without a signature, anyone
with the URL can start a run with any content. A signature only proves which
service sent the request: a GitHub payload still carries text written by any
GitHub user.

For GitHub, turn on **Require signature**, keep the header
`x-hub-signature-256`, hex encoding and the `sha256=` prefix, and enter the
same secret in the repository's webhook settings with content type
`application/json`. Requests without a valid signature are rejected. Set this
up on desktop or web; mobile keeps an existing signature check but can't turn
one on.

To run only for some requests, add **Filters**. Each one tests a value named
like a placeholder, without the braces, such as `headers.x-github-event` equals
`pull_request` or `body.action` is one of `opened, reopened`. A task runs only
when every filter matches; other requests are answered normally, logged as
**Filtered** with the first filter that failed, and start nothing. Values
compare as text, and a value that is an object or a list only passes
**exists**. Separate **is one of** values with commas; a value can't contain
a comma or start or end with a space.

To suppress repeated deliveries, set a **Duplicate request key** template, such as
`{{headers.delivery-id}}`. The same key is ignored for seven days per task.
To combine a burst, set a **Coalesce key**, such as `{{body.id}}`, and a window
of 10–3600 seconds (120 by default). One run uses the latest body, headers,
and query when the window from the first delivery closes; later requests
do not extend it. Pending windows survive a server restart. Keys must contain
request placeholders; if any placeholder is missing, or the render is empty,
that key's rule is skipped. Clear the templates to turn dedupe off.

Duplicate and coalesced log entries share a limit of 10 per task per minute.
Additional deliveries are accepted without a log entry, and coalesced deliveries
always replace the persisted payload. Coalesced updates count toward a separate
60-per-minute validation limit; exceeding it receives HTTP 429.

On desktop and web, pick **Deliveries** from a task's menu to see recent
requests and the prompt each one produced.

If the environment is offline, the sender gets an error and nothing runs;
redeliver from the sender, such as GitHub's **Recent Deliveries**, once it is
back. d4research does not store webhook requests outside your environment.
To skip requests that waited too long before delivery, set **Skip requests older
than** on the task.

## Defaults and inheritance

Threads contains the model and workspace for new threads. Browser controls agent browser
access. Source control contains automatic pull, the default pull request merge method and text
generation. The same rows edit environment defaults or project overrides depending on the
project crumb.

The Projects category, under Code, holds the project's name, icon, actions,
checkouts and removal. Actions belong to a project: editing them creates the project's own list
on each selected environment, and reset returns to the environment's shared list. A project's
`t3.json` actions can be imported there.

Settings a repository can also declare in `t3.json`, such as the workspace for new threads,
resolve in one order: a project override, then the environment setting, then `t3.json`, then the
built-in default. Leave a setting on **Inherit** to let the next tier decide.
Browser access changes apply when an agent session next starts.

New worktrees initialize git submodules recursively. If that step is slow because the repository
declares many nested submodules, set **Submodules** in **Settings → Worktrees** under Advanced (with the project
selected to override it there) to **Top level only** to stop at the ones the repository declares
itself, or **Skip** to leave them for a setup script. It resolves in the same order as the
workspace default: a `"worktreeSubmodules"` value in the `t3.json` of the branch being checked out
applies when the project and environment are both on **Inherit**.
Project names, icons, removal, and importing actions from a checkout remain project-specific.
When there are several checkouts, the checkout picker selects which actions, grouping, and project
memories to edit.

## One project on several machines

A project shows every folder that belongs to it, on any connected machine. Folders that share a
Git remote are matched by default. A folder without a Git remote has nothing to match by, so
attach it by hand.

To add a folder as part of a project you already have, choose **Add project**, pick the machine,
then pick the project under **Part of an existing project** before choosing the folder or
repository. To attach a project you already added, open **Settings → Projects**, select it, and
use **Show under another project** in **Grouping**. **Detach** in the same place undoes it.

Attaching changes only how this device groups the projects. Each folder keeps its own files,
threads and settings, and nothing is copied between machines. Once attached, a new thread's
machine menu lists every machine that has a folder for the project. Mobile does not show
hand-made attachments.

### Files Git does not carry

Git moves tracked work between machines. For the rest, such as `.env` files, large files and
ignored data, ask an agent in one of the project's threads: "copy `.env` to the Mac mini", or
"check what the mini has that this machine is missing". The agent sees your other machines and
the project's folder on each, lists and compares files there, and copies files or folders either
way.

Agents reach only project folders and thread worktrees, never delete, and need a **Full access**
thread to copy. The app carries the files, so the desktop or web app has to be open and connected
to both machines. Mobile does not carry files.

## Project memory

Select a project in Settings → Projects and open Project memory. Add an entry with a short name,
a description of when to use it, and its content. Edit reads the full entry; Delete asks for
confirmation. You can also ask an agent to remember a fact for the project.

New threads receive a short memory index on their first message. Agents read relevant entries
through T3 Code's MCP tools rather than loading every memory into every prompt. Updates are
available through those tools immediately, but the initial index is not repeated in an existing
conversation. Memories may become stale, so verify details before using them for consequential work.

Memories stay in the hosting T3 Code database and are shared by the project's threads, including
threads using worktrees or multiwork copies. A separately registered project or another environment
has its own memories. Do not store passwords, API keys, or other secrets.

## Worktree location

New worktrees go in the `worktrees` folder of the T3 home directory. To put them somewhere else,
such as another drive, set **Settings → Worktrees → Worktree location** to an absolute path like
`D:\worktrees` or `~/worktrees`. The setting is per machine. Existing worktrees stay where they
are, and cleanup covers both the default folder and the custom one.

## Storage cleanup

Open **Settings → Worktrees → Cleanup** to enable automatic cleanup on one machine or all connected
environments. Worktree removal on settlement is on by default; the other worktree rules are off.
Cleanup runs on the server at startup, when changed, and hourly. Offline machines keep their existing policies.

Select a project to set **Automatic worktree cleanup** to **Inherit**, **Off**, or **Custom**.
Inherit follows each machine's rules; Off keeps that project's worktrees until you remove them
manually. Custom applies separate worktree rules to the selected project or checkout. Browser
captures and log retention remain machine-wide.

Worktrees can be removed after a chosen number of inactive days, after a thread settles, after
merging, or when they have no commits beyond the default branch. Set settled retention to 0 days
to remove a worktree at the next cleanup after settlement. In repositories without remotes,
unchanged-worktree cleanup compares against the branch checked out in the project workspace;
if that checkout has a detached HEAD, the worktree is kept. Only T3-managed worktrees are eligible.
Active sessions and shared worktrees prevent removal. **Keep worktrees with local changes** defaults
to **Any local files**, which protects tracked edits, untracked files and ignored files other than
`node_modules`. **Uncommitted changes** protects tracked edits and untracked files but allows ignored
files such as `.env` and build output to be deleted. **Edited tracked files** protects only tracked edits and allows untracked and
ignored files to be deleted. Branches and thread history stay; starting another turn recreates the checkout.
Merge cleanup requires a merged pull request whose commits are included in the remote default
branch. A squash or rebase merge on GitHub also counts when the pull request targeted the default
branch and the worktree is still at the pull request's last commit.

Enable **Delete worktrees with deleted threads** to remove safe worktrees after their last
thread is deleted, including archived threads and worktrees left by earlier deletions. The
server waits for sessions and terminals to stop and retries skipped worktrees after restart.
Existing prompts for deleting a worktree manually remain available when this policy is off.

Choose **Delete now** to run the enabled rules immediately. The latest results show which
worktrees were removed or kept and why, plus any failures.
Results also list folders in the worktree folder that no thread uses, with their sizes; cleanup never removes them, so remove them manually if you want.

Browser captures and rotated logs have separate retention periods. Expired capture links stop
working. Current logs, message attachments, and browser profiles are kept.

## Project icons

Select the project and open Project to choose an icon, emoji, monogram, or image. The choice applies to
every checkout in the project group and appears on connected clients. Choose **Automatic** to let
d4research detect an icon again.

Choose **Monogram** in the icon picker to set one or two letters or numbers and a color.

When no image is found, web and desktop show a two-character monogram with a color
from the icon palette, derived from the saved project name. For example, `Nebula` becomes `NA`,
`Silver Orchard` becomes `SO`, and `M7 Forge` becomes `M7`.

## Keep the default branch current

In Source control, enable **Automatically pull** to keep the default-branch checkout up to date
with its configured upstream. Choose an environment to set the default or a project to override it.
On mobile, use **Settings → Source control** to change selected environment defaults or project overrides.

d4research only pulls when it can fast-forward and the checkout has no changed files, untracked files,
or local commits. It skips checkouts on another branch or without an upstream. If a checkout has
local work, resolve it yourself before automatic pulls can resume.
