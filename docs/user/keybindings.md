# Keybindings

Customize shortcuts in **Settings → Keybindings** on web and desktop. That page
also lists the command IDs and defaults available in your version.

## Composer controls

In **Settings → Chat → Send shortcut**, choose whether Enter sends, requires
`mod+Enter` for multiline prompts, or always requires `mod+Enter`. `Shift+Enter`
inserts a new line. This applies to the web and desktop composer at desktop widths.

**Follow-up behavior** chooses Queue or Steer while the agent runs. Use
`mod+Enter` to do the opposite for one message, even when the send shortcut
requires a modifier. `mod+Alt+Enter` sends, keeps that thread running in the
background, and opens a fresh new-thread composer. In a new thread, `mod+Enter`
does the same. Change these shortcuts in **Settings → Keybindings** under
**Composer: Opposite Queue or Steer Action**, **Composer: Start in Background**,
or **Composer: Send and Start New Thread**. These bindings take priority over the
send shortcut. Click the send button to use the configured follow-up behavior.

When an active turn has queued messages, `mod+Shift+Enter` sends the first as a
steer. Change it under **Queue: Send First Queued Message** in Keybindings.

Use `mod+shift+m` to choose a model and `mod+shift+h` to choose a host.
To step a new thread to the next machine instead of opening the menu, bind
**Composer: Cycle Host** in Keybindings. It has no default shortcut.
Use `mod+shift+e` for effort, `mod+shift+a` for permissions, `mod+shift+x` for the
workspace, and `mod+shift+g` for the Git branch. The workspace menu includes the
current checkout, a new worktree, and the previous worktree when available.
Use `mod+shift+l` to reuse the previous worktree directly.

To change effort one step without opening the picker, bind
**Composer: Increase Effort** and **Composer: Decrease Effort** in Keybindings.
Both are unbound by default. Increase wraps from the highest level to the
lowest, and decrease wraps from the lowest level to the highest.

In the model picker, press Left in an empty search field or Shift+Tab to reach
the provider list. Use Up/Down to move and Enter to choose. Right returns to
model search. `mod+shift+up` and `mod+shift+down` switch providers directly and clear the
search. These provider shortcuts can also be changed in Settings.

These shortcuts run inside the focused web or desktop client. `mod` uses Command
on macOS and Ctrl on Windows and Linux, including GNOME, KDE Plasma, Niri, and
Hyprland. If a custom desktop shortcut takes the same keys, choose another binding
in Settings.

## Project slots

On web or desktop, open the sidebar's project selector, highlight a project, and
press `Ctrl+Alt+1` through `Ctrl+Alt+9` to save it in a slot. Repeating the same
assignment clears the slot. Assigning another project replaces its previous occupant.
Slots are saved on this device and follow logical project grouping.

In the desktop app, `mod+1` through `mod+9` select the saved project in the sidebar.
Customize `project.jump.1` through `project.jump.9` and `project.assign.1` through
`project.assign.9` in **Settings → Keybindings**. Mobile shortcuts are unchanged.

## Copy pull request references

With a PR open in the right panel or on the Pull requests page, use `mod+shift+c`
to copy its URL and `mod+shift+k` to copy its number with a `#` prefix.
Both shortcuts can be changed in Settings. Search for “Copy Link or Thread”
or “Copy Number”. They copy the selected PR and leave terminal input alone.
Without a PR, `mod+shift+c` copies the thread itself, which pastes into a
composer as a thread chip.

## Find in a diff

Click into a diff in the Diff panel or a pull request's Code tab, then press
`mod+f` to search every file in it, including folded files and unchanged lines
hidden between changes. Enter and `Shift+Enter` move between matches, and a
match in a folded file opens it. Escape closes the search. This shortcut is not
configurable. A very large uncommitted diff loads its files as you scroll, and
find only searches the files loaded so far.

## iPad

With a hardware keyboard, use `Cmd+1` through `Cmd+9` to open the first nine
displayed threads. The shortcuts follow the current list filters and order.
`Cmd+K` opens the command palette to search commands, projects, and threads.
Use the arrow keys and Return to choose a result, or `Cmd+1` through `Cmd+9` to
choose directly. Escape or `Cmd+K` closes the palette. Start a search with `>`
to show only actions.

In a new thread, `Cmd+Shift+H` moves the draft to the next machine.

In the composer, Return sends and `Shift+Return` inserts a new line. `Cmd+Return`
also sends. To make Return insert a new line instead, change the Return key
behavior in Settings → Keyboard.

## Edit the configuration file

Keybindings live on the environment's machine, in
`~/.t3/userdata/keybindings.json` by default. You can edit this file directly.
It is a JSON array of rules:

```json
[
  { "key": "mod+g", "command": "terminal.toggle" },
  { "key": "mod+shift+g", "command": "terminal.new", "when": "terminalFocus" }
]
```

T3 Code creates the file with its defaults and adds new defaults on later startups.
New defaults do not replace commands you customized. If a new default overlaps one
of your shortcuts, [rule order](#precedence) decides which runs.
Invalid rules are ignored; if the file cannot be parsed, T3 Code uses defaults.

## Rule shape

Each rule requires a `key` shortcut and a `command` ID. An optional `when`
expression restricts when it runs.

Project scripts use `script.{id}.run`, such as `script.test.run`.

## Key syntax

Join modifiers and a key with `+`, such as `mod+shift+d` or `ctrl+l`.
`mod` means Command on macOS and Control elsewhere. Other modifiers are
`cmd` / `meta`, `ctrl` / `control`, `alt` / `option`, and `shift`.

## When conditions

Available context keys are `terminalFocus`, `terminalOpen`, `previewFocus`,
`previewOpen`, `modelPickerOpen`, `usagePageOpen`, `composerFocus`, `composerDraft`,
`turnRunning`, `editableFocus`, `isWeb`, and `isDesktop`.
`editableFocus` is true while a text field, the composer, or another editor has
the keyboard. `isWeb` is true in a browser tab. `isDesktop` is true in the
desktop app. Unknown keys evaluate to `false`.

`mod+1` through `mod+9` jump to saved project slots, and to models while the
model picker is open. Project jumps do not run while the model picker is open.
These defaults use `isDesktop` to preserve the browser's tab-switch shortcuts.
Remove that condition in Settings to enable project jumps in a browser.

Combine keys with `!` for not, `&&` for and, `||` for or, and parentheses:

`rightPanel.toggle` shows or hides the right panel, and `rightPanel.toggleMaximized` maximizes or
restores it, defaulting to `mod+alt+m`. Pressing the latter while the panel is closed opens and
maximizes it in one step. Both answer wherever you are in the app and whatever has focus, which
makes them safe to bind to a bare key such as `§`; the exception is Settings, where a keypress
belongs to the page you are editing the binding on. Hiding the panel gives up its maximized state,
so it never reopens filling the workspace.

`project.jump.1` through `project.jump.9` scope the sidebar to a project, defaulting to `mod+1`
through `mod+9`. To fill a slot, open the project menu at the top of the sidebar, point at a
project, and press `ctrl+1` through `ctrl+9` (`project.assign.1` and up). The slot's shortcut then
shows on that project's row, and a project answers to one slot at a time. Which project a number
recalls is stored on the device you set it on.

`structure.open` opens the file structure view and defaults to `mod+shift+1`. `thread.jump.1`
through `thread.jump.9` still exist and can be bound, but no longer claim `mod+1` through `mod+9`
by default. A keybindings file written before project slots existed is carried over on startup:
numbered thread jumps become the matching project slots, and a `mod+1` file-structure rule moves to
`mod+shift+1`.

`editor.navigateBack` and `editor.navigateForward` step through the files you have opened in the
editor, returning to the exact line you left. Each defaults to two shortcuts, `ctrl+left` and
`mod+[` for back, `ctrl+right` and `mod+]` for forward, because macOS reserves the `ctrl` pair for
switching desktops.

`rightPanel.close` closes the active right panel tab and defaults to `mod+w`. Press it again to close
the next tab. With the terminal focused, `mod+w` closes the terminal instead, and with nothing left
to close it closes the desktop window as before. Browsers reserve `mod+w` for closing their own tab
and never pass it to the page, so in a browser rebind this command (and `terminal.close`) to a
shortcut the browser leaves alone, such as `alt+w`.

`thread.copyReference` copies the active thread's pull request link, or its thread ID when no pull
request is available. Its default shortcut is `mod+shift+c`, and it does not replace terminal copy
while the terminal has focus.

`thread.settle` settles the active thread or restores it when it is already settled. Its default
shortcut is `mod+shift+s`, and it does not run while the terminal has focus.

`thread.pin` pins the active thread to the pinned section of the sidebar, or unpins it when it is
already pinned. Its default shortcut is `mod+shift+p`, and it does not run while the terminal has
focus. See [Organizing threads](./thread-sidebar.md) for how pinned threads are ordered.

The command palette searches settings, active thread titles, projects, branches, user messages, and
final agent responses across connected environments. A setting result opens its exact control or
section. Message matches show one labeled excerpt while keeping the thread's project, branch, and
machine context visible. Message search begins after two characters and uses SQLite's ASCII
case-insensitive matching.

The full command list and the current defaults are shown in **Settings** → **Keybindings**, which
always matches the build you are running. Use that rather than a copied list.

Note that `chat.new` and `chat.newLocal` both create a thread through the same path. A new thread
inherits the project you were in, along with model and mode selections. Branch, worktree, and
environment mode always come from your configured defaults, not from the thread you were looking
at. To keep a worktree, use the explicit "new thread in this worktree" action in the branch
toolbar. The only difference between the two commands: with the current sidebar and more than one
project, `chat.new` opens a project chooser first.

Background submission from a new thread is the exception. `mod+enter` starts that thread and opens
another new thread with the same workspace mode and base branch. **New worktree** remains selected,
but the new thread does not reuse the worktree created for the thread that just started.

## `when` Conditions

A `when` expression is evaluated against context keys describing the current UI state. The keys
the app supplies today are `terminalFocus`, `terminalOpen`, `previewFocus`, `previewOpen`, and
`modelPickerOpen`. The set is open and grows over time, so treat that as the current list rather
than a fixed one. Any key the running app does not supply evaluates to `false`.

Operators: `!` (not), `&&` (and), `||` (or), and parentheses.

Examples:

- `"when": "terminalFocus"`
- `"when": "terminalOpen && !terminalFocus"`
- `"when": "!terminalFocus"`

## Find in the current thread

`chat.find` searches conversation messages and proposed plans in the active thread. Entering a
query searches the entire thread, including older messages. Thread search requires server support;
update an older server to enable it. Select **Retry** if a search fails. It defaults to
`mod+f` outside terminals and previews. Press **Enter** or **Shift+Enter** to move between matches,
and **Escape** to close find.

## Precedence

The last rule whose key and condition both match wins, even if it belongs to a
different command. Put a more specific rule after a general one when they share
a shortcut.

## Commands with special behavior

`thread.stop` interrupts the running turn in the focused thread. It has no default
shortcut; assign one in **Settings → Keybindings**.

`thread.undo` (`mod+z` by default) reverses the actions shown in the notice at the
bottom of the sidebar, such as unpin, settle, snooze, archive, or discarding a
draft. Consecutive
actions of the same kind undo together. The notice remains available for five
seconds after the latest action. Right after an action, the shortcut works even
in a text field such as the composer. Once you type or press another key, the
field gets its own undo back. Terminals always keep their native shortcut.

`navigation.back` (`mod+[` by default) and `navigation.forward` (`mod+]`) move
through the pages you have visited, like a browser's back and forward buttons.

`chat.new` may ask you to choose a project when there is more than one.
`chat.newLocal` skips that chooser. Both use your
[new-thread defaults](./thread-sidebar.md#start-a-thread). `chat.newWithoutProject`
(`mod+alt+n`) starts a thread [without a project](./thread-sidebar.md#start-without-a-project).

## Reserved shortcuts

In the desktop app, `mod+w` closes the focused terminal or the active right-panel
tab. When nothing remains to close, it does nothing; it never closes the window. In a browser, `mod+w`
closes the browser tab; rebind `rightPanel.close` and `terminal.close` to an available
shortcut such as `alt+w`.

`mod+shift+t` reopens the last closed tab across the app, including files,
diffs, pull requests, browsers, and devices, in the order you closed them.
A browser opens in a fresh session without its old page history. Incognito tabs
can reopen until you reload or quit the app. This shortcut does not undo deleted work.
Browsers also use it to reopen browser tabs; choose another binding in Settings
if the browser takes it first.

Many defaults include `!terminalFocus` so they do not intercept terminal input.
Keep that condition when remapping them if you want the same behavior.

## Desktop quit shortcut

Use `Cmd+Q` on macOS or `Ctrl+Q` on Windows and Linux. In the default **Hold** mode,
hold for 1.2 seconds or press twice within 500 milliseconds. Holding requires
keyboard repeat; if repeat is disabled, use two presses or the application menu.

Change **Settings → General → Confirmations → Quit shortcut** to **Direct** for a
single press or **Double press** for two presses only. Choosing **Quit** from the
application menu always quits immediately.
